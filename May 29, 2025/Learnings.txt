					Divisibility

2 -> last digit should be even.
3 -> sum of digits should be divisible by 3
4 -> last 2 digits should be divisible by 4
5 -> last digit should either be 0 or 5
6 -> number should be divisible by both 2 and 3
7 -> 2*last digit, when subtracted by the rest of the number, the difference obtained should be divisible by 7.
8 -> last 3 digits should be divisible by 8
9 -> sum of the digits should be divisible by 9
10 -> last digit 0
11 -> difference of alternating sum of digits should be divisible by 11
12 -> number should be divisible by both 3 and 4

2,4,8 -> last 1,2,3 should be divisible by 2,4,8
3,9 -> sum divisible by 3/9
5,10 -> last digit 0/5 , 0
6,12 -> number divisible by both 2,3 and 4,3
7 -> 2778 => (277-(2*8))%3
11 -> diff of sum of alternating digits
